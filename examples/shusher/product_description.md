# Shusher

You know that person. The one video-calling their divorce lawyer on speakerphone at the coffee shop. The one who treats the quiet coach like a broadcast studio.

You've thought about saying something. You won't. Nobody does.

Shusher is a small puck you aim at the offender. When the noise stays unreasonable, it fires a brief "shhh" in their direction — loud enough for them to hear, quiet enough that nobody else notices. They pause, look around, lower their voice. It sounded like a person. It wasn't.

Five styles: classic librarian "shhh," pointed throat-clear, gentle "ahem," whispered "excuse me," and passive-aggressive sigh.

Looks like a coaster. Works like a bouncer. No confrontation required.
