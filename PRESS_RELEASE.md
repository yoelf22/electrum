# Electrum: An Open-Source Toolkit for Defining Hardware Products That Have Software Inside

**Electrum provides a structured, AI-assisted process for taking a hardware+software product idea from concept through engineering spec to presentation-ready materials — in seven phases.**

Hardware products with embedded software — sensor-driven devices, firmware-controlled actuators, IoT systems — sit at an awkward intersection. Software teams have PRDs and sprint planning. Hardware teams have datasheets and DFM checklists. But the boundary between the two, where the most expensive integration mistakes happen, is usually the least documented part.

Electrum addresses this gap with a repeatable seven-phase workflow:

1. **Explore** the idea and map the HW/SW boundary
2. **High-Level Design** — a single-page system overview with blocks, interfaces, and constraints
3. **System Description** — a full engineering-grade spec with real components, power budgets, and firmware architecture
4. **Gate Checklist** — 90-item validation across both domains (PASS/FAIL/N/A)
5. **Image Generation** — product illustrations via DALL-E
6. **PPTX Carousel** — a polished LinkedIn-format slide deck
7. **PDF Carousel** — the same deck as a shareable PDF

The toolkit includes markdown templates, a 90-item gate checklist, a 16-area skills map, reference Python scripts for generating visuals and presentations, and three worked examples covering different product types.

Electrum integrates with Claude Code as a single `/electrum` command. Describe a product idea, and the system walks through all seven phases interactively — drafting documents, generating illustrations, and building presentation decks. Each phase pauses for human review before moving on.

The toolkit also works without AI. The templates and checklists stand alone as structured guides for any hardware PM working at the HW/SW boundary.

**Availability:** Electrum is available now on GitHub under an open-source license.
