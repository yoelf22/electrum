# System Description Toolkit

A structured approach to writing architecture-level system descriptions for IoT and smart connected devices.

## What This Is

Templates and guidance for the document that sits between a product concept and a formal PRD. The system description captures the "what and how at system level": subsystem breakdown, interfaces, key technical decisions, and constraints.

## Quick Start

1. Read `hw_sw_product_initiation.md` for the full process
2. Review `skills_map.md` to identify your knowledge gaps
3. Copy `templates/system_description_template.md` to your project folder
4. Write your system description section by section, using the prompt questions
5. Validate with `checklist.md`

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skills_map.md` | 15 competency areas for IoT system description writing |
| `templates/system_description_template.md` | Guided template with sections, prompts, and diagram placeholders |
| `checklist.md` | Completeness checklist — run before converting to PRD |
| `hw_sw_product_initiation.md` | Process guide: idea → system description → PRD |
| `examples/smart_sensor_hub.md` | Partially worked example |

## Target Audience

Hardware product managers working on IoT and smart connected devices who need to bridge the gap between product concept and engineering requirements.
